# SOLID Principles in PHP
SOLID Principles coded in PHP scripting language.

## 1. Single responsibility
    - a class or a module should have only a single responsibility
    - there should be only one reason to change a class or module

## 2. Open/closed
    - classes, functions, modules should be open for extension, but closed for modification

## 3. Liskov substitution
    - when extending a class, remember that you should be able to pass objects of the subclass in place of objects of the parent class without breaking the client code

## 4. Interface segregation
    - classes that implement interfaces should not be forced to implement methods they do not use
    - it is better to have many small interfaces, rather than a few large interfaces

## 5. Dependency inversion
    - high level objects should not depend on low level implementations. Both should depend on abstractions.
    - abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
